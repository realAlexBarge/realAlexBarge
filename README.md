## Applied AI & Cloud Architect | Regulated Systems | Frontier AI & Agents

I design and scale high-impact AI and cloud systems in complex, regulated environments.

With over a decade of experience spanning engineering, architecture, and entrepreneurship, I operate at the intersection of AI platforms, security, compliance, and business strategy. My work focuses on translating emerging technologies - especially AI - into reliable, production-grade systems that organizations can trust.

As a Senior Solutions Architect at AWS, I advise high-growth startups across EMEA on architecture strategy, AI deployment, and secure cloud design. I specialize in helping companies in FinTech, Healthcare, and other regulated industries move from early experimentation to scalable, audit-ready platforms.

Previously, I co-founded and served as CTO of a venture-backed startup, leading it from concept through product-market fit to successful exit. This experience shapes how I approach technology today: systems must not only work—they must scale, endure, and create leverage.

I am particularly interested in sovereign AI infrastructure, responsible AI governance, and the operational realities of deploying frontier models and agents in production environments.
